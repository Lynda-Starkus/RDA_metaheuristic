- it's a population based meta
- Harem : group of female RDs which mate with a male commander
- the males fight and roar to get the harem
- 3 behaviors : Raoring - Mating - Fighting
- Females prefer high roaring to low roaring
- A male rd can seek multiple mating attemps before the successful one
- Winner RD will seize the territory of losing RD

- Steps of algo :
- generating initial rd : random points of size Npop, we choose the best RDs to Nmale and the rest Nhind
- Roar male RDs : here RD tries to increse a grace by roaring and male red deers are allowed to change position
- Take alpha% of best male deers as male commanders
- Stag = males - commanders chosen
- We let the commanders and stags fight randomly, and select them after fighting if objective function is better than prior
- Forming Harems : 
	- Weird formula
- Mating the male commander with beta% hinds in his harem
- Mating the male commander with gamma% hinds of another harem
- Mating every stag with nearest hind
- Select next gen : male RDs are chosen as the best solutions and hinds are chosen with tournament selection or roulette wheel or any other mechanism for selection with fitness
- Convergence : nb_iter or  quality of thee best solution or a time intervall


remarks: 
- intensification is guarenteed by fighting and male commanders selection
- diversification is guarenteed by the mating process of commanders and stags
- Escaping local optimums is guarenteed by next generation
